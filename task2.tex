\section{Introduction}
Stance detection means to determine the viewpoint on a certain topic, person, organisation or similar. Most often a distinction in an approving, a disapproving or a neutral stance is made.\\ 
To create such a stance detector a system needs to be trained with the help of a training set containing already predeterminded stances and the corresponding. 

In contrast to sentiment analysis the stance towards a topic is exermined even when the target does not explicitely occur in the test medium. 


\section{Methodology}
use of training set
- tokenisation
- feature: stopwordremoval
- bigramm analysis
- vocabulary extraction
- vector creation


\section{About the Implementation}
- tokenisation with nltk tweet tokenizer

Features:
- stopword removal with nltk stopword list
- words of length 1 deleted

creation of vector

classifier

\section{Discussion}

"In fact, one can argue that stance detection can often bring complementary information to sentiment analysis, because we often care about the authorâ€™s evaluative outlook towards specific targets and propositions rather than simply about whether the speaker was angry or happy."
